r-package-installer
===================

Shell script to install user-local R packages with no interactive configuration - just give it a list of packages on the command line

Sanity checks the package names against a regex for valid R names and ensures that the user's default R install directoy exists.

Was created to be used with sudo, to allow a specific user to install R packages into the home space of an unprivaledged service user that a Shiny websever runs as without allowing them to directly run arbitary commands (R or otherwise) as the service user.
